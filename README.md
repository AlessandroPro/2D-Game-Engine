# 2D Game Engine

This project was imported from Gitlab. <br>
All relevant code is in /Engine/.

This is a functional 2D game engine written in C++ by a team of 11 programmers. It is based on the design of the Unity game engine, with game objects that have components. Internally, it uses SFML to handle things like rendering sprites, transforms, etc.

It includes the following subsystems:

* Game Object Manager
* File Manager
* Input Manager
* Asset Manager
* Render System
* Collision System

### My Contribution

I was responsible for managing the Game Object Manager sub-system, which was a team of 3 people, including myself. <br>
We implemented the following classes:

* Object
* Component
* Game Object Manager
* Game Object
* Transform

My main contribution was GameObject.cpp.
